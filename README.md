# IntersellarNX
InterstellarNX is what i hope can be a replacement for KosmosNX feturing everything you need to get started with switch CFW. As of right now i have a working atmosphere based ready to go setup but i hope to make a Reinx version as well.

# Getting started with IntersetellarNX

getting sarted with InterstellarNX is relativley easy all you have to do is grab the relase file wich will contain all the files you need to put on your sd card as well as the files necessary to start up interstellarNX. Once the relase file is downloaded you can drop the files in the folder labeled SD on to your sd card and Then put it into your switch. from there you can boot into RCM mode and smash the payload.
